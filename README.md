# EV Route Planner

A React-based Electric Vehicle route planning application with Mapbox integration for finding charging stations along your route.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Click on the map to set source and destination points
- **Route Planning**: Visualize routes between source and destination
- **Charging Station Discovery**: Find charging stations along your route
- **Real-time Data**: View station availability, pricing, and wait times
- **Filter Options**: Filter stations by availability, type, price, and renewable energy
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set up Mapbox Access Token

1. Go to [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and create a free account
2. Get your access token from your Mapbox dashboard
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
echo VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_actual_mapbox_token_here > .env.local
```

Replace `your_actual_mapbox_token_here` with your real Mapbox access token.

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5174` (or the next available port).

2. **Plan Route**:
   - Click "Plan Route" to calculate the route
